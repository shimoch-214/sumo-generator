            Techniques of small ghoul combos are based on player's experiences.
            So if you are a bigginer in this technique, you would waste a lot of time
            because of lack of experiences. You can try some sample combos with Sumo Generator.

            Safe Settings?
          </h5>
          <p>
            Positions and action orders of your monsters are critical parameter in a combo.
            A wrong setting quickly destroys your combo, and brings you a deep grief.
            Sumo Generator simulates a combo with whatever a setting you want to try.

            Even you are a experienced player, it is difficult to estimate the
            natural health healing for each monster. 
            We don't want to moune for killer machines which are killed unexpectedly.
            Sumo Generator reproducts those complex behaviors. If you want to check the 
            source code in the simulation, please check
